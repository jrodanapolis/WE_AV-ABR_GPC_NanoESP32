# WE_AV-ABR_GPC_NanoESP32
WE Coffee Co. Gear Pump Controller software for Arduino Nano ESP32 microcontroller

This is the W.E. Coffee Co. gear pump controller ("GPC") software, designed for an Arduino Nano ESP32 and the GPC PCB (coming soon).

It is designed to be used with a Fluid'O'Tech FG304 gear pump. Contact me if you'd like a new but unwarrantied FG304 for $250 (bought a lot of these when I found them for $250, as they are normally $690 brand new!).

The BOM can be found here:

A 2021 Acaia Lunar will automatically connect to the Arduino using this software package (the La Marzocco brew by weight scale is NOT required, but should also work). Make sure the Lunar firmware is up to date using the Acaia Updater app. NOTE: After uploading the code to the Arduino, make sure to do a full power down or the Lunar will not connect. Sometimes Bluetooth is not initialized properly during the restart process.

PCBs, wiring kits, mechanical parts kits (paddle/potentiometer assembly for EMP mode and pump bracket), and hydraulics kits are in the works. Getting everything to work together has been a major undertaking!

Please reach out with any questions or to get involved or if you're working on a similar mod - we'd like as many contributors as possible, and I love hearing about other projects!
